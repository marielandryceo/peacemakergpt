## About PeaceMakerGPT

**PeaceMakerGPT** is an open-source AI system designed to **proactively monitor** global public discourse for early signals of conflict escalation.  
Using **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, PeaceMakerGPT detects coded warmongering, hate speech, and incitement to violence — empowering citizens everywhere to safeguard peace.

## Mission

- **Early Detection**: Identify emerging threats before escalation.
- **Decentralized Accountability**: Enable people-powered peacekeeping beyond governments.
- **Ethical Transparency**: Respect human dignity while opposing calls for violence.
- **World Peace by 2026**: Build a movement of 1,000+ global users monitoring, verifying, and advocating peace.

## Legal Foundations

PeaceMakerGPT is fully aligned with:
- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)** (1948)
- **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** (1966)
- **United Nations Charter** (1945)

We believe technology must uphold the **freedom, dignity, and life of all people**, while actively preventing incitement to violence and hate.

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marielandryceo/peacemakergpt.git
cd peacemakergpt
```

**2. Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Or configure for no-code deployment on OpenAI, Poe, Google Gems via prompt-based setup.)*

**3. Deploy PeaceMakerGPT**

- Use `peacemakergpt_prompt.txt` for immediate setup on CustomGPTs.
- For Poe/Google, paste the **core system prompts** into their bot builders.
- Follow the included `deployment_instructions.md` for detailed setup.

---

## How It Works

- PeaceMakerGPT monitors OSINT feeds (public data, speeches, media, social media).
- It analyzes linguistic patterns for:
  - **Warmongering Language**
  - **Incitement to Violence**
  - **State-Sponsored Hate Speech**
  - **Escalation Signals**
- Alerts are generated based on severity, and users can report findings to independent verification networks.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- **Respect Freedom of Expression**: PeaceMakerGPT flags incitement, not legitimate speech or criticism.
- **Verify Critical Findings**: Cross-validate findings through decentralized verification groups.
- **Ethical Deployment Only**: Use PeaceMakerGPT only for peacekeeping, transparency, and human rights advocacy.
